# !! Don't change this !!
# This is used to detect version-changes in the plugin 
# and update configuration and web-files correctly.
version: "1.0.0"

web {
	# With this setting you can disable the web-server.
	# This is usefull if you want to only render the map-data for later use, or if you setup your own webserver.
	enabled: true
	
	# The webroot of the website that displays the map.
	webroot: "bluemap/web/"
	
	# The IP-Adress that the webserver binds to.
	# If this setting is commented out, bluemap tries to find the default ip-adress of your system.
	# If you only want to access it locally use "localhost".
	#ip: "localhost"
	#ip: "127.0.0.1"
	
	# The port that the webserver listenes to.
	# Default is 8100
	port: 8100
	
	# Max number of simultaneous connections that the webserver allows
	# Default is 100
	maxConnectionCount: 100

	# Unncomment this to override the path where bluemap stores the data-files.
	# Default is "<webroot>/data"
	#data: "path/to/data/folder"
}

# This changes the amount of threads that BlueMap will use to render the maps.
# A higher value can improve render-speed but could impact performance on your minecraft-server.
# This should be always below or equal to the number of available processor-cores.
# If this value is commented out BlueMap tries to find the optimal thread count to max out render-performance but still leaving some space for the minecraft-server:
# (threadCount = <core-count> * 0.75; Max 16; Min 1)
#renderThreadCount: 2

# This is an array with multiple configured maps.
# You can define multiple maps, for different worlds with different render-settings here
maps: [

	{
		# The id of this map
		# Should only contain word-charactes: [a-zA-Z0-9_]
		id: "world"
	
		# The name of this map
		# This defines the display name of this map, you can change this at any time
		# Default is the id of this map
		name: "World"
		
		# The uuid or name of the world to render on this map
		world: "world"

		# If this is false, BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are not visible from above-ground.
		# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.
		# This improves the performance of the map on slower devices by a lot, but might cause some blocks to disappear that should normally be visible.
		# Default is false
		renderCaves: false
		
		# AmbientOcclusion adds soft shadows into corners, which gives the map a much better look.
		# This has only a small impact on render-time and has no impact on the web-performance of the map
		# Default is true
		ambientOcclusion: true

		# Lighting uses the light-data in minecraft to shade each block-face.
		# If this is enabled, caves and inside buildings without torches will be darker.
		# Default is true
		lighting: true
		
		# HIRES is the high-resolution render of the map. Where you see every block.
		hires {
			# Defines the size of one map-tile in blocks.
			# If you change this value, the lowres values might need adjustment as well!
			# Default is 32
			tileSize: 32
			
			# The View-Distance for hires tiles on the web-map (the value is the radius in tiles)
			# Default is 3.5
			viewDistance: 3.5
		}
		
		# LOWRES is the low-resolution render of the map. THats the model that you see if you zoom far out to get an overview.
		lowres {
			# Defines resolution of the lowres model. E.g. If the hires.tileSize is 32, a value of 4 means that every 8*8 blocks will be summarized by one point on the lowres map.
			# Calculation: 32 / 4 = 8
			# You can only use values that result in an integer if you use the above calculation!
			# Default is 4
			pointsPerHiresTile: 4
			
			# Defines the size of one lowres-map-tile in points.
			# Default is 50
			pointsPerLowresTile: 50
			
			# The View-Distance for lowres tiles on the web-map (the value is the radius in tiles)
			# Default is 4
			viewDistance: 4

	# Things we dont want to change from default we can just omit
