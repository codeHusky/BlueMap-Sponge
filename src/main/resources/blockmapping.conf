# This config maps the block id and statevalues to the .json filename from the resourcepack/blockstates and the statevalues there! 
# 
# If a block or file is not defined here it defaults to the blocks id without mod prefix,
# so minecraft:acacia_door will match to acacia_door.json
#
# Example: 
# "minecraft:dirt[variant=podzol]" = "podzol"
