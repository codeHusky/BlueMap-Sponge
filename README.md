# BlueMapSponge
**Currently not stable or finished!**

This is a sponge plugin implementing a live renderer for [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap).<br>
BlueMap is a minecraft mapping tool that creates 3D models of your Minecraft worlds and displays them in a [web viewer](https://bluecolored.de/bluemap/).

## Clone
Easy:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap-Sponge.git`

## Build
In order to build BlueMapSponge you simply need to run the `./gradlew build` command.
You can find the compiled JAR file in `./build/libs`

## Installing the plugin
This should be as simple as putting the plugin jar in the `mods` folder of your sponge server, and starting it.<br>
Then you can open `http://<server-ip>:8100/` in your browser to view the map!
